# Task Submission for Frontend Developer Position at Funsol

Dear Funsol Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

## Task Overview

I am writing to provide an update regarding the task assigned to me for the frontend developer position at Funsol. I made every effort to complete the task as per the requirements, but I encountered an issue with the provided API for POST requests.

## API Issue

Despite my best efforts, the POST API you provided did not function as expected. I previously informed you about this issue and was hoping to receive a working API to complete the task. Unfortunately, without a functioning POST API, I was unable to upload images, manage the progress bar, and handle files as required.

## Alternative Solution

Given the time constraints, I opted to use a different live API to demonstrate my skills and complete the task. The alternative API allowed me to dynamically append data, showcasing my abilities in a similar context.

## Evaluation Focus

Since the primary API component was non-functional, I kindly request that you focus on evaluating the responsive design aspects of my submission. These elements are independent of the API functionality and accurately reflect my capabilities as a frontend developer.

## Interest in Funsol

I am very keen to join the Funsol team and contribute to your projects. If there are any doubts or concerns regarding my submission, I am more than willing to undertake another task with a working API to further demonstrate my skills.

## Contact Information

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or require additional information.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of working with Funsol.

Sincerely,

Muhammad Ammar
